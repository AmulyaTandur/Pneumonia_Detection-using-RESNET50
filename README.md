# Pneumonia Detection Using Transfer Learning

* Pneumonia is a potentially serious respiratory illness that affects one or both lungs and is commonly caused by bacterial, viral, or fungal infections.
 
* Chest X-rays are widely used to identify pneumonia, but their interpretation requires a trained medical professional. Delays or inaccuracies in diagnosis often result in severe consequences, including loss of life.
* Advancements in computing power have made it feasible to create automated systems for pneumonia detection and treatment, which can be especially beneficial for patients in remote locations with limited access to healthcare services.
* In this project, we aim to identify the presence of pneumonia using chest X-ray images. 
* In this Web application, we used a Transfer Learning model [**RESNET50**](https://keras.io/api/applications/resnet/) for prediction

* This Web application is created and deployed in [**Streamlit**](https://streamlit.io/)
